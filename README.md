An IME is an Input Method Editor. It is how you can create your own custom input method for Android.
Most often this is an on-screen keyboard but it could be anything.  Some input methods are for inputing numbers.
Some are for inputing symbols.  Most are for alphanumeric input.

I am David Jensen.  I work for STG, Software Technology Group.  I intend to create an article on how I created my own custom IME for Android.
It is meant as an exercise to learn native Android development.  Hopefully, I can develop it enough to release it on the Google Play market.
I will probably offer it for free.

My IME will be for accurate input using short swipes.  You drag your finger toward the key that you want to hit.
The most used letters will be close and the least used will be on the fringes.  This will optimize input.
One caveat of this input method is that you will have to learn a new keyboard layout.  So, I don't intend
this IME to catch on to the general public because people are attached to their method of typing into their
phones.  The standard QWERTY keyboard is what's expected for any device and I don't believe I will change that.
But it serves as an interesting exercise to explore the possibilities and learn Android development at the
same time.
